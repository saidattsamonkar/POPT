# Sortino Ratio NIFTY 50 Portfolio Optimization

## Description

This Project uses SciPy's SLSQP to optimize for Sortino Ratio and generate weights to actively manage NIFTY 50 Portfolio. 


## Data 

The pool consists of equities which were in NIFTY 50 at the end of 2009. Equity data is fetched using the yfinance API.


## Steps 

1. Fetch equity returns data from t-1 to t-n
2. Optimize the data to get the Maximum Sortino Ratio (Rf is considered to be 0) subject to the following constraints
   - Weights should be equal to 1 
   - Portfolio turnover ratio should be less than the specified limit
   - Sector weights should be less than the specified limits
3. Run simulation on the current month t and save the returns and update the new portfolio weights 


## Results

The optimized portfolio had superior returns delivering 28.69% higher mean monthly returns at the cost of 1.54% higher monthly mean standard deviation when compared to the benchmark.

The following graph shows the IR of the Sortino optimized portfolio and the IR of an ideal portfolio. The ideal portfolio was generated by passing the current month's data to the optimizer, so that we can generate the best possible portfolio from the equities available to us.
